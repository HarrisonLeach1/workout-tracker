# Workout Tracker

An app to create workout routines and exercises to track your workout progress during self-isolation.

## Motivation

I created this app to learn new technologies such as [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/). I also enjoy working out and wanted full control in analysing my workout data.

The application was also built with React hooks, React Native, TypeScript as I enjoy using these technologies.

## Usage

You can try out the app [here](https://expo.io/@harrisonleach1/workout-tracker) through Expo.
